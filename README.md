# plain-TDD
This repository is for a Test Driven Development (TDD) code expressed in plain terms, without a technical debt of a third-party standards:
- [x] test.cmd: define and invoke a set of isolated test cases with Metric and Input specification
- [x] test.cmd: pass defined variables to assert.cmd for staging of Input evaluation  
- [x] assert.cmd: stage assertion of Input evaluation in isolated CMD /S runtime and log ('test.cmd.log') the test case details
- [x] assert.cmd: markdown results with red - FAIL, green - PASS, blue - stdOUT/errOUT of Input evaluation
- [x] assert#ErrorLevel.cmd: evaluate Input with ErrorLevel from Input expansion
- [x] assert#stdOUT.cmd: evaluate Input with ErrorLevel from string match of Input expansion stdOUT
