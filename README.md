# Welcome
This repository is for a Test Driven Development (TDD) code expressed in plain, without a technical debt from a third-party framework or library:
- [x] test.cmd: assert Fact from evaluated Argument staged in a format Remark-Act-Fact
- [x] test.cmd: assert.ErrorLevel uses 'CMD /C fromScript.cmd Argument' for the Argument evaluation  
- [x] test.cmd: assert.Readability uses manual input for evaluation of readability of output from 'vivid.cmd'
- [x] test.cmd: red - FAIL, green - PASS, blue - Argument evaluation  
- [x] test.cmd: test case details are logged in the 'test.cmd.log'  
- [x] fromScript.cmd: expands and evaluates Argument passed by reference at position %1
- [x] vivid.cmd: changes console color to vivid and readable using ANSI escape code
